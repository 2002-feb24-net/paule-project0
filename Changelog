    Created base framework
        creators, managers, objects, main, inputcollector
    Working username database
    working way to register
    working way to set password
        included many checks and failsafes
    bad word filter for usernames
    incomplete data fields for objects and managers
    many new methods for person manager, store manager, inputcollector, mainmanager
    added stock and stock manager
    just realized I didnt use the creators at all
        need to rewrite the code to include them or delete them
    heavy console based code in input collector and main manager
    build ends upon successfully logging in
