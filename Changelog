    Created base framework
        creators, managers, objects, main, inputcollector
    Working username database
    working way to register
    working way to set password
        included many checks and failsafes
    bad word filter for usernames
    incomplete data fields for objects and managers
    many new methods for person manager, store manager, inputcollector, mainmanager
    added stock and stock manager
    just realized I didnt use the creators at all
        need to rewrite the code to include them or delete them
    heavy console based code in input collector and main manager
    build ends upon successfully entering a valid username

3/8/20
    Added stockcreator
    personcreator is now utilized
    planned out initialization of initial user base and info fields (not implemented yet)
    fixed bug with mainfile class name
    removed creatorparent
        creators are going to be too different from each other to have a parent class
        and if there was a parent class, method names would be too generic to have clear code
    added more blacklist words

3/9/20
    Now asks for password after username
    Added initialization of existing users with manager and creator creation
    moved name and location list to creator for more logical code placement
    reworked some redundant method calling
    set many fields and references to private
    reworked person creation to personcreator, as well as the methods involved
    removed redundant managers
    began a menu system after logging in
        currently you can go to:
            store
            history
            account
            admin
            (or quit)
    started store menu and implementation
